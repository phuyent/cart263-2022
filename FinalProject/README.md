# Artist's Statement

by Huyen Tran Pham

In this project, I initially want to create a replica of a real-life gallery. However, that took more time than I expected, then I decided it could still be a gallery as long as there are pieces of art.

Therefore, in this project, I want to present 5 rooms displaying different 3D experiences using THREE.js library.

Room 1: Sending Something Out
This is mostly a space for affirmations. However, the room comes with a listener known as Annyang, who will reply to your affirmations.

Room 2: Popping Balloons
Not only can you stare at the balloons for hours, you could also pop them by clicking on any balloons. This can also help if you need to relax.

Room 3: Across the Surface
This room is filled with cubes moving towards you. You can dodge them playfully by using the arrows keys. If not, you can sit and watch them pass by or pass through you.

Room 4: Rain of Donuts
This one room would make Homer Simpson happier than ever. Just sit and admire the curves of this scrumptious snack falling down on you.

Room 5: Spotlights
This room is randomly generating cubes and shine a light on whatever insight. Imagine sitting in this space and waiting to discover something when the light hits.

Throughout all 5 rooms, I do hope you could get somewhat of an experience with 3D geometry. Having intended to replicate a real gallery, there are rooms you do not get to touch the pieces, you just need to watch. On another note, there are rooms where you can interact and be in a space of imagination. Hopefully, my gallery did have some sort of impact on you.
