THE CODED MULTIDISCIPLINARY GALLERY

While carrying on with the project, I do not want it to be another museum anymore, the space could be used to transit a person anywhere just sitting in front of the screen. This has opened endless possibilities. Therefore, I added the 'multidisciplinary' word, this space could feature any form of artwork as long as it can be interpreted.  

Artistic Vision

At first, I keep the idea of displaying the pictures on walls like any other gallery. Afterwards, I would imagine within these walls, what else could be on display?  

In the final project, there will be five rooms:

First room: recapture the experience of walking in a room full of photographs, but not being able to touch the artwork like in any museums. This room is based on the contemporary art gallery with its modern features.

Second room: the structure of the second room is similar to the first one. However, the Renaissance theme would make a great difference. Thus, there would be music and navigations around the room.

Third room:  This is a meditative space to transform the viewers into a new space. There will be a voice guiding you and some fortune-telling as well.

Fourth room: A recreation of a exhibition known as “Imagine Van Gogh” where the participants could immerse into the world of Van Gogh’s paintings.

Fifth room: A miniature model of the yellow room from Olafur Eliasson’s “Room for one colour” project. This is where people start to question more on hue,saturation,lightness,brightness.

User experience

Through the virtual space, even though we are sitting in front of the screen, I hope it will somehow lessen the realms of existence and increase the excitement of exploration.

The Outcome

This project has been challenging in terms of management personally. It may not be as elaborate as planned. However, it is an potential, on-going project that I could extend more afterwards. In the near future, there will be a complete version that would please the users better.
